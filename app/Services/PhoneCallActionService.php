/**
 * The four agent-side call-log writes Charlie asked for, over the SAME service
 * methods the staff web actions use (card 6aac3226dfebbc36fd7ff4f9). No new
 * domain logic lives here: PhoneCallService::setBillable / markFollowedUp do the
 * work, PhoneDirectoryEntry is written exactly as
 * PhoneDirectoryController::addFromCall writes it, and the re-transcribe path is
 * byte-for-byte CallController::transcribe's status flip + detached command.
 *
 * TWO OF THE FOUR ARE NOT ORDINARY WRITES, and they follow the precedent
 * PhoneCallResolutionService set rather than a new one:
 *
 *  - set_call_billable RE-RUNS PrepayService::debitFromPhoneCall (through
 *    setBillable), so it moves prepay hours on a client contract. It is money.
 *  - block_caller is CLIENT-VISIBLE IN EFFECT: the PHLO reads
 *    PhoneDirectoryEntry and hangs up on a blocked number
 *    (PlivoWebhookController::resolveCaller), so one agent write silences a real
 *    phone line. allow_caller is its inverse and rings a number through.
 *
 * All three are therefore DEFAULT-UNGRANTED including legacy full-surface
 * tokens; a bare or `:staged` grant HOLDS for cockpit approval and only an
 * explicit `:immediate` grant executes now; and a held proposal REVALIDATES at
 * approval — the call still exists, still carries the ticket link the prepay
 * contract resolves through, the number still parses, and the directory has not
 * changed underneath. A stale proposal is consumed as stale, never applied blind.
 *
 * mark_call_followed_up and retry_call_transcription are lower-consequence and
 * take the ordinary granted-immediate intake-manage shape, the same one
 * link_call_to_ticket and create_ticket_from_call already use for the same
 * records (both of those also write phone_calls rows and touch billability
 * through linkCallToTicket). They are still default-ungranted: membership in the
 * intake-manage family confers nothing without the operator's per-tool grant.
 *
 * followed_up_at is the technician's resolution marker that link_call_to_ticket
 * and create_ticket_from_call refuse to override. mark_call_followed_up SETS it
 * and never clears it, so it cannot be used to launder a call past those two
 * refusals in the other direction; a call already followed up is reported as
 * unchanged rather than re-stamped with a new actor.
