/**
 * get_hdb_report (card c5JaSetu): the HelpDesk Buttons press report for one
 * HDB note on one ticket, over staff MCP. Read-only: it writes nothing and
 * only calls {@see HdbReportClient}, which reads.
 *
 * AUTHORITY (#1359). The fetch goes through
 * {@see HdbReportClient::fetchForNote()} and nothing else: the note must be a
 * live note on the ticket, carrying the press id the PSA captured. The input
 * has no press id or link, and `tickets.hdb_press_id` (a last-note-wins
 * display cache) is never read here.
 *
 * VISIBILITY. The authorizer does not consider the acting user or the client
 * scope of the caller, so this tool applies the same fence get_ticket_attachment
 * applies before anything else: the ticket must belong to client_id (refused
 * with the same text), it must not be an unverified contact intake, and the
 * note must pass TicketNote::automationVisible(). Only then is the report
 * client called, so a refused call issues no request to the portal.
 *
 * OUTPUT. A payload status (fetched, degraded) returns the vendor's decoded
 * JSON plus the screenshot in get_ticket_attachment's image shape and under
 * its ceilings. Every other status returns `error` naming why nothing was
 * returned. The press id is not returned (LinkedIds keeps it off reads so it
 * cannot be pasted back as a fetch key).
