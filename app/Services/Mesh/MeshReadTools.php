/**
 * The two Mesh read tools, mesh_search_email_logs and mesh_get_email_events, in
 * ONE place for every surface that runs them: the staff Assistant, staff MCP
 * (which reaches them through AssistantToolExecutor) and the triage loop (card
 * 6abdcac2, the Huntress pattern from #4486 applied to Mesh).
 *
 * client_id is the key. It resolves through the client's stored Mesh mapping,
 * clients.mesh_customer_id, and through nothing else: there is no customer,
 * domain or mailbox fallback. from/to/subject/status only narrow the rows of
 * that one customer.
 *
 * WHAT THE VENDOR GIVES US, and what it does not. Mesh is closed-source and its
 * OpenAPI 1.0 document declares both routes as "200: No response body", so the
 * row shape is not specified anywhere we can read. GET api/emaillogs/ takes no
 * customer parameter: it answers with a partner-wide page, which PSA filters to
 * the client by each row's customer id (the `list` envelope and the
 * Customer-ID / "Customer Id" keys are what this code has read since the
 * initial release). GET api/emaillogs/events takes only queue_id, so the vendor
 * call itself cannot be bound to a customer. The binding is therefore made
 * here, in PSA:
 *   - search serves only rows whose customer id is this client's, and records
 *     the queue id of each row it served under this client's key;
 *   - events accepts a queue id only if this client's own search served it
 *     (QUEUE_TTL_SECONDS), and refuses an events answer naming another customer.
 *
 * Fails closed, with an error that says why, never with a cross-client read:
 *   - no client_id; a client_id that does not resolve to the client held;
 *   - a client not mapped to Mesh;
 *   - a Mesh customer id another PSA client also carries (trimmed,
 *     case-insensitive), because the rows could not be attributed to one client;
 *   - a search answer without a `list` array, or carrying an error;
 *   - a queue id this client's search did not serve, an empty or error events
 *     answer, or one naming another customer id.
 *
 * Key names are matched case- and separator-insensitively (Customer-ID,
 * "Customer Id", customer_id are one key), because the vendor's casing is not
 * documented and a missed key must never read as "no mail".
