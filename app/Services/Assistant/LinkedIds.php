/**
 * The `linked_ids` block served by get_client, get_asset and get_ticket_detail.
 *
 * Why it exists: an agent answered "no Huntress org" and "no ScreenConnect
 * session" for records that HAD both ids, because no read tool published them.
 * Every foreign-key and external-integration id column on the row is emitted
 * here, and a column holding NULL is emitted as an explicit null meaning
 * "not mapped" — never omitted, so an agent can tell "not mapped" from
 * "this tool does not say". The one exception is tickets.parent_ticket_id,
 * which is also null when the parent sits outside the ticket's client fence
 * (see forTicket).
 *
 * The column lists are hand-maintained ON PURPOSE and pinned by
 * tests/Feature/Assistant/LinkedIdsContractTest, which reads the live schema:
 * every *_id column and every declared foreign key on clients/assets/tickets
 * must appear in its list or in DENYLIST with a reason. A new column added
 * without either fails that test, so a new integration cannot silently go
 * unpublished again — and a new SECRET-shaped column cannot silently be
 * published either, because someone has to decide which list it goes in.
 *
 * Lists below were taken from the migrated schema at 60cf6ca6 (which agrees
 * with the models' fillable/casts), not from the card's prose list.
