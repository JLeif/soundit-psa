/**
 * The outcome of one press-report fetch: a status, a closed-vocabulary reason,
 * and — only on a fetch that got far enough — the decoded payloads.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAYLOAD IS. `ticket` and `report` are the vendor's own decoded JSON,
 * after redaction ({@see HdbReportRedaction}) and never before it. They are
 * vendor-controlled data, so they are DATA: nothing in this object is
 * safe to interpolate into a rendered surface without escaping, and the
 * operator-facing {@see message()} deliberately draws from a fixed list rather
 * than from anything the portal said.
 *
 * WHY A DEGRADED FETCH STILL CARRIES ITS PAYLOAD. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
 * § "Vendor response shapes" rule 3: a degraded read must SCREAM rather than
 * return a clean empty result. Returning `[]` for a `report.json` that arrived
 * missing `eventLog` would read to a technician as "that machine logged no
 * errors", which is the false all-clear that rule exists to forbid. So the
 * bytes that DID arrive are preserved, {@see $missingSections} names what did
 * not, and the status is Degraded — which is not Fetched, and any caller
 * branching on `ok()` writes nothing.
