/**
 * Read-only fetch of one HelpDesk Buttons press report (psa #340 / #1359).
 *
 * READS ONLY, and one endpoint family only: `gatekeeper_auth.php` with
 * `getFile=` one of the four whitelisted filenames. `/toggleverify.php` MUTATES
 * vendor state — it marks a report verified — and is never called from this
 * repo; do not add it to {@see FETCHABLE_FILES} or anywhere else.
 *
 * ── FIELD SOURCE, and what it does not prove (STANDARDS C-56(1), C-56(2)) ────
 *
 * HDB is not open source and publishes no OpenAPI spec, so the vendor's
 * producer cannot be read. The best source that exists is the household vault
 * plan `wiki/sound-psa/soundit-dev/plans/`
 * `2026-09-04-hdb-report-integration-build-guide.md`, §5 (endpoints, redirect
 * chain) and §6 (`ticket.json` keys, `report.json`'s 17 top-level sections),
 * written from a live capture of a real press on 2026-09-04 and marked
 * `[VERIFIED]` there. Every field name and every URL shape in this class is
 * cited to that note.
 *
 * 🔴 THAT NOTE IS A SECOND-HAND TRANSCRIPTION, NOT A CAPTURED PAYLOAD, and the
 * fixtures in {@see \Tests\Feature\Hdb\HdbReportClientTest} are therefore
 * SYNTHETIC — invented hostnames, users and addresses, written from the note's
 * key list. C-56(2) asks for fixtures copied from the vendor's real payload and
 * this slice CANNOT supply that: the only real capture contains a client's
 * hostnames, usernames, MACs, local addresses and a desktop screenshot, none of
 * which may enter this repo, and no live call to a third party's portal was
 * authorized for this build. So state the limit plainly rather than dress it up:
 *
 * - What the tests prove: this client's own decisions — the authorization gate,
 *   the upload gate, the redaction gate, the origin policy, the section check,
 *   fail-soft — hold on payloads shaped as the note describes.
 * - What they do NOT prove: that the note transcribed the vendor's key names
 *   and value TYPES correctly. If `uploadComplete` is really a string `"1"`, or
 *   `redactScreenshots` is really `redactScreenshot`, every guard here refuses
 *   rather than mis-imports — that is why each unreadable field fails closed
 *   with its own symbol — but it refuses on EVERY press, which is a loud
 *   failure on first live contact and is the intended shape of being wrong.
 * - What would close the gap: one capture from a real press, scrubbed of client
 *   identity, pinned as a fixture. That is an owner decision, not this
 *   client's.
 *
 * ── DEGRADED READS SCREAM (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § Vendor response shapes) ────
 *
 * Nothing here ever fails closed into an empty array. A `report.json` that
 * arrives without `eventLog` is not a machine with no event log — it is a bug,
 * and it comes back as {@see HdbReportStatus::Degraded} naming the missing
 * sections, with `importable()` false so no caller can write a false all-clear
 * onto a ticket. A body that is not readable JSON is Malformed, not empty. A
 * missing `uploadComplete` is its own symbol rather than either default.
 *
 * ── FAIL-SOFT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@see fetch()} NEVER throws: every failure is a status. The original HDB link
 * note is untouched on every path through this class — nothing here writes to a
 * ticket at all, which is the strongest form of that promise. Writing is the
 * import path's job, and it may only write on `importable()`.

     * client's same-origin redirect pin — the real chain deliberately leaves
     * the portal origin, and pinning it would refuse every report. What IS
     * pinned instead, and it is the meaningful half:
     *
     * - the FIRST request goes to the configured, resolved portal origin, via
     *   the same {@see HdbPortalConfig::baseUrlVerdict()} the credential path
     *   uses — so a repointed Portal URL cannot aim a session at a host the
     *   integration would not post to;
     * - every hop must be https, so the session cookie never rides cleartext;
     * - the hop count is bounded ({@see MAX_REDIRECTS}).
     *
     * The residual is stated rather than hidden, and the thing holding the
     * line is NAMED because it is not this method. An off-origin hop carries
     * whatever Guzzle's cookie jar considers in scope for that host, so a
     * portal that redirected somewhere hostile would see a request arrive. The
     * portal's session cookie does NOT go with it: `CookieJar::withCookieHeader`
     * (vendor/guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Cookie/CookieJar.php:301, read at this tip)
     * emits a cookie only when `matchesDomain($host)` holds for the request's
     * own host, and only over https when the cookie is Secure.
     *
     * That is the JAR's behaviour, not a check this method makes. A reader
     * should know the difference: if the redirect policy here were ever loosened
     * to allow http, or the jar swapped for one that does not scope by domain,
