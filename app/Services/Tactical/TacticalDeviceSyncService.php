     * hostname, serial, logged-in username, LAN address. TacticalClient's SSRF
     * pin leaks by the same mechanism, naming the Tactical host and the address
     * it resolved to. That string does not stay in one place:
     * SyncResult::$errorMessages is rendered by the integrations settings view,
     * returned verbatim by StaffTacticalAdminToolExecutor (an MCP surface), and
     * written to storage/logs/laravel.log, which has no rotation configured.
     *
     * SCOPE — this covers exactly the six catches in this class that
     * recordError() into SyncResult::$errorMessages: the client-map read, the
     * agent fetch, the queued-action pre-scan, the per-agent write and the
     * not-seen offline sweep in syncDevices(), and the asset lock in
     * linkOrCreateAsset(). $context names
     * which one, so the message stays truthful about what was attempted
     * without reproducing what it was attempted with.
     *
     * The first and third were added for psa #359. They are the reason this
     * scope note is worth keeping accurate: before them, two unguarded reads
     * sat ABOVE every catch in this method, so a QueryException from either
     * left syncDevices() entirely and was flashed raw by the controller. This
     * helper was not incomplete from those reads — it was unreachable. A stale
     * "three catches" here would have described a boundary that no longer
     * holds, which is the failure mode this note exists to prevent.
     *
     * TWO THINGS IT DOES NOT COVER. Read this as the boundary, not as a
     * class-wide or surface-wide guarantee:
     *
     *  - syncDeviceDetail()'s catch returns DetailSyncResult::degraded() to the
     *    refresh-now JSON and does not route through here. It leaks nothing
     *    today because that message is a constant — a property of the current
     *    string, NOT of this helper. Routing it is ticketed.
     *  - The log surface is NOT closed for the SSRF pin.
     *    TacticalClient::resolveAndPin() writes the host, and on the
     *    private-address path the resolved IP, to that same unrotated log
     *    unconditionally BEFORE it throws. Redacting the message here closes
     *    the settings view and the MCP executor; it does not and cannot close
     *    the log. Ticketed separately.
     *
     * What an operator can actually act on is the failure class, the driver's
     * SQLSTATE and its errno, which is what they get. The driver's own message
     * is withheld: it is the part that embeds values (a duplicate-key error
     * quotes the offending binding back verbatim). The agent_id or client_id is
     * carried alongside at each call site, so the failing record stays
