/**
 * AutoElevate stage 3a: link vendor computers to PSA assets. Pattern: ControlDDeviceSyncService.
 *
 * SCOPING IS THE WHOLE POINT. Hostnames repeat across clients (measured 2026-09: 566 assets,
 * many shared names), so a computer is ONLY ever matched against live assets of the ONE client
 * whose `autoelevate_company_id` it was read under. Company scope itself is proven upstream by
 * AutoElevateReadService::normalizeComputer() (a row from another company is `row_drift`), so
 * this layer does not re-implement it; it composes computersForCompany() per mapped client.
 *
 * Never creates an asset. A computer with no hostname match in its client is REPORTED
 * (count + per client); one whose name fits 2+ live assets, or whose name 2+ computers share,
 * is reported as ambiguous and left unlinked rather than guessed.
 *
 * A failed read for a client changes NOTHING on that client's assets (C-56: a degraded read
 * is not evidence the machines are gone). Links are cleared only after a SUCCESSFUL read that
 * did not return the computer, or when the asset's client is no longer mapped.
 *
 * Written values: the vendor's elevationMode VERBATIM (null stays null — never defaulted to
 * "audit"; an unrecognised value is kept and flagged at render), lastCheckedInAt (already a UTC
 * instant from normalizeComputer), synced_at. `autoelevate_agent_version` is NOT written: the
 * Partner API 1.0.0 Computer schema has no such field (verified 2026-09-22).
 *
 * PACING AND EARLY STOP (#3420, #3414). The vendor rate-limits reads per route (see RATE
 * LIMITS in AutoElevateReadService's class docblock). Measured 2026-09-23: back-to-back reads of 57
 * clients gave 33 × http_429; reads 4-8 s apart gave 8 of 8 ok. So sync() waits
 * CLIENT_SPACING_SECONDS before every client read except the first. It stops reading once
 * STOP_AFTER_CONSECUTIVE_429 clients IN A ROW fail with http_429 (the limiter is not
 * recovering, and every further client would spend its retries for the same failure), or once
 * MAX_RUN_SECONDS have passed; the deadline is checked between clients, so a read already in
 * progress runs to its own bound. Clients left unread are reported as SKIPPED: no read was
 * made, so exactly as for a failed read their links and recorded outcome are left unchanged,
 * and clearUnmappedClients() still treats them as mapped.
