     * Ownership is 404, not 403: this route is reached only by the button,
     * and an invoice id from another client's ledger should read as "no such
     * invoice" to a probe rather than confirm it exists. The BenjiPays path
     * is re-checked here (toggle, QBO id, status) so a form submitted after
     * the toggle was turned off gives up on the link like the button would.
     *
     * A mint failure is logged (reason and status only, never a vendor
     * string). Both exits to Stripe go through stripeFallback(), and both are
     * guarded: every page renders this POST only while
     * paysOnlineViaBenjiPays() is true, so EITHER exit is reached from the
     * BenjiPays surface, whose balance note drops the full-amount caveat. A
     * PARTIALLY PAID invoice must therefore not be silently bounced to the
     * full-total Stripe page from either — the overpayment #1173 exists to
     * prevent — including from a page rendered under the toggle and clicked
     * after it was turned off or the key cleared, which is exactly the stale
     * form this re-read exists for. Otherwise the client goes to the Stripe
     * page if the invoice has one, else back to the invoice with a generic
     * flash — never a vendor message.

     * and the three portal surfaces render that POST only while
     * paysOnlineViaBenjiPays() is true — a toggle-off (or no-key) install
     * renders a direct Stripe link instead and never arrives here. So the page
     * behind every click was the BenjiPays surface, which drops the "will
     * charge the full $X" caveat because the vendor page is priced at the
     * balance. A partially paid invoice must therefore not be sent to the
     * full-total Stripe page without the amount named — the overpayment #1173
     * exists to prevent — whether the mint failed or the predicate re-read
     * turned false between render and click.
     *
     * Nothing is refused forever by guarding: the invoice page this returns to
     * is re-rendered under the CURRENT config, so a toggle that stayed off
     * shows the full-amount caveat and today's Stripe link, one click away.
     *
     * Guarded on the Stripe URL too: with no Stripe page there is no
     * full-amount route to withhold, and saying otherwise would tell the
     * client something false about their own invoice.
