        // A failed validate() redirects withInput(), and the framework's
        // own $dontFlash list carries exactly three entries:
        // current_password, password and password_confirmation. Every other
        // submitted field -- including an API key, a webhook secret or an
        // admin password -- is written to the session's _old_input so the
        // form can be repopulated. SESSION_ENCRYPT is false, so that value
        // is serialised to the session driver in the clear and outlives the
        // request that failed by the length of the session.
        //
        // This is registered once, here, rather than guarded per action.
        // The alternative is a hand-written strip in every controller method
        // that accepts a secret, which is a rule enforced by ~20 separate
        // remembering-to-do-its and silently absent from the next one
        // written. Registering it against the handler covers every validation
        // failure, FormRequests included, and ones that do not exist yet. It
        // does NOT cover an action that calls ->withInput() itself:
        // RedirectResponse::withInput() flashes the whole request and never
        // consults this list, so such an action must strip the secret
        // locally, as PreferencesController does for sip_password.
        //
        // A local strip is still correct where an action wants the secret
        // out of the request entirely rather than only out of the flash;
        // LITSRMM does that. This list is the floor, not a replacement.
        //
        // Names are the validated field names, not the Setting keys they are
        // stored under. Deliberately excluded: assistant_daily_token_limit,
        // triage_daily_token_limit, triage_max_tokens_per_run and max_tokens
        // (integer budgets), generate_secret and has_secret (booleans), and
        // mcp_token_label (a display label). Those carry a credential-shaped
        // NAME and no credential; suppressing them would break form
        // repopulation for no gain.
        //
        // 'credentials' is the client vault, and its editor is prefilled with
        // the stored copy, so an unflashed edit would be replaced without any
        // sign. clients/_form.blade.php shows a notice when that happens.
        //
        // Two names here carry no credential affix at all, so a sweep keyed on
        // _key/_secret/_token/password will not find them. Both are secrets:
        //
        //   'token' is the portal password-reset token (PortalAuthController
        //   validates a bare 'token'). It is single-use and short-lived, but a
        //   failed reset -- a weak new password, a mismatched confirmation --
        //   flashes a still-valid reset token into the session, and the token
        //   is the whole authentication for that request. Nothing repopulates
        //   from it: the form sources the token from the route parameter, not
        //   from old input, so unflashing it costs nothing.
        //
        //   'keys' is the PowerDMARC per-client API key map ('keys[<client
        //   id>]' in the form, vendor JWTs over 1300 characters). An array is
        //   flashed whole, so one failed submit writes every operator-entered
        //   key for every client into _old_input. That form re-renders from
        //   the stored rows behind a mask and never reads old('keys'), so it
        //   also repopulates unaffected.
        //
        // Neither name is used for anything else in a validation rule: they
        // are unambiguous here, which is why the plain names are safe to list.
