# Red-check harness: apply one BEHAVIOURAL mutation, run the suite, record the
# failure count, restore from the COMMITTED tip (never from an unverified tree).
#
# Each mutation must change behaviour while leaving signatures intact. A mutant
# that only changes a declaration would prove the suite asserts declarations.
#
# A mutant is KILLED only when the suite ACTUALLY RAN and ACTUALLY FAILED. The
# per-mutant verdict is parsed from the PHPUnit summary and cross-checked against
# the process status; it is never inferred from an exit code alone, because a
# shared exit code is not an assertion. A run that could not start (no vendor/,
# no binary, timeout) is an ERROR -- neither a kill nor a survivor -- and is
# loud. Any survivor, skip or error makes the whole harness exit non-zero.
#
# set -e is deliberately NOT used: this script runs commands that are EXPECTED to
# exit non-zero (every killed mutant), and an implicit exit between mutate and
# restore would leave the tree dirty. Statuses are checked explicitly instead.

  # A green BANNER is not proof that anything was ASSERTED, and "not skipped"
  # is not the same as "asserted". There are TWO green banner shapes and BOTH
  # have to be counted -- not just the one that is followed by a "Tests:" line:
  #
  #   SummaryPrinter::print() emits "OK (N tests, M assertions)" when the run
  #   was successful with nothing skipped and no issues. M is allowed to be 0
  #   (#[DoesNotPerformAssertions], expectNotToPerformAssertions(), or
  #   beStrictAboutTestsThatDoNotTestAnything="false"), so this banner is NOT
  #   proof of assertion either -- and it IS that run's count line: no separate
  #   "Tests: ..." line is printed alongside it.
  #
  #   The bare "OK, but there were issues!" banner carries NO counts of its own
  #   and is always followed by the "Tests: N, Assertions: M, ..." line.
  #
  # There are TWO of them, and an earlier revision of this guard only understood
  # one. Read from the producer (vendor/phpunit/.../TextUI/Output/SummaryPrinter.php
  # and Runner/TestResult/TestResult.php), not from output I happened to see:
  #
  #   wasSuccessful()      = no errored, no failed, no phpunit-error events.
  #                          It IGNORES incomplete and risky entirely.
  #   hasTestsWithIssues() = risky OR incomplete OR deprecations OR notices
  #                          OR warnings.
  #
  # so a run in which every test calls markTestIncomplete() in its BODY is
  # "successful with issues": it prints "OK, but there were issues!" with
  # "Tests: 14, Assertions: 0, Incomplete: 14." and exits 0. Those tests were
  # prepared and DID emit testFinished, so "No tests executed!" never fires and
  # numberOfTestsRun() is 14 -- while zero assertions were made. Subtracting
  # only "Skipped:" admits exactly that run, and the harness would then score 14
  # mutants against a suite that asserted nothing and call them all SURVIVED.
  #
  # So: require at least one test to have run that was NOT skipped and NOT
  # incomplete, AND require at least one assertion -- read from WHICHEVER of
  # the two shapes the producer printed, so neither banner can bypass the
  # check. Risky is NOT subtracted: a risky test RAN and its assertions ARE
  # counted (the Collector only flags it), so subtracting it would refuse a
  # healthy, asserting baseline; an all-risky run that asserted nothing is
  # already caught by the zero-assertion check below. Skipped and Incomplete
  # are printed under their own tokens by printCountString(), never folded
