# gc-verify.sh — SoundIT PSA pipeline quality gate.
#
# The single source of truth for "is this change shippable?". Run by the
# Gas City implementer formula's `check` step (so a bead cannot close and a
# PR cannot be opened unless it is green), by the CI workflow on every PR,
# and by humans on demand.
#
# Gates:
#   1. php artisan test          — the full PHPUnit suite must pass without warnings.
#      Enforced by TWO independent belts, because --fail-on-warning alone was
#      measured to be partial: it does not fail on the @-suppressed read at
#      vendor/vlucas/phpdotenv/src/Store/File/Reader.php:73 that Laravel's error
#      handler surfaces in the summary's `warnings` column. Belt one is
#      --fail-on-warning (PHPUnit's own exit policy); belt two parses the
#      summary line and requires warnings == 0. An unrecognised summary is a
#      FAIL, never a PASS — this gate fails closed on a format it cannot read.
#      Risky tests and deprecations (including PHPUnit metadata deprecations)
#      retain PHPUnit/config defaults; this gate does not newly fail on them.
#   2. pint --test (changed PHP) — code style, scoped to the PHP files this
#                                  branch changed vs main. The repo carries
#                                  pre-existing style debt, so we hold only
#                                  NEW/changed code to the standard, not the
#                                  whole tree.
#   3. real-data / secret guard  — fail if the diff reintroduces operator
#                                  emails, private keys, or known token shapes
#                                  (this is a public OSS repo).
#
# Environment: vendor/ must already be installed. A missing .env is PROVISIONED
# here the way CI does it (cp .env.example .env; php artisan key:generate)
# rather than tolerated, because a worktree without .env does not fail — it
# silently converts ~7100 real passes into `warnings` and still exits 0.
# Exits non-zero on the first failing gate.

# --- belt two's parser is loaded HERE, before the expensive stages -----------
# THE PARSER LIVES IN scripts/lib/gc-verify-summary.sh, and is sourced rather
# than defined here. Both test harnesses need the SAME function; while it lived
# inline they recovered it by regex and `eval`'d the text they recovered, which
# is GitHub #2650/#2655/#2665 -- a sed range bounded by where it ends, not by
# what it contains. Sourcing a file that defines the function and executes
# nothing removes the extraction, the validation and the eval together. Ruled by
# Jeeves on Trello card 6aadcd16 (2026-09-18): one definition, two consumers.
#
# This is the only source path, so a missing or unloadable library is a FAIL,
# never a skipped belt: belt two silently not running is how a 7286-warning
# floor passed as PASS in the first place.
#
# IT RUNS BEFORE STAGE 1 BY DELIBERATE ORDERING. In round 1 this block sat after
# `php artisan test`, so "library missing" was reported only after a ~7800-test,
# ~900s run had already completed. Loading the parser costs milliseconds and has
# no dependency on any stage, so there is no reason for the discovery to be
# expensive.

# PROBE IN A SUBSHELL BEFORE SOURCING FOR REAL.
#
# This is not a lexical guard and it does not inspect the library's text: it
# LOADS the file and asks whether loading it actually produced the parser. Three
# r1 findings collapse into that one question, and all three were measured:
#
#   * a syntactically broken or partially-written library aborted the gate with a
#     raw `syntax error` and NO named FAIL (it failed closed, but silently);
#   * a library with a top-level `exit 0` terminated the gate at rc=0 with belt
#     two, pint and the secret guard NEVER RUN -- a green gate that checked
#     nothing, which is precisely the silent-skip class this wiring exists to
#     close, arriving through the new source path;
#   * `declare -F` alone was satisfied by an exported function INHERITED from the
#     caller's environment, so an impostor could stand in for the parser while
#     the library on disk was empty.
#
# The probe closes all three because it is an execution test, not a text test:
# `$( )` is a subshell, so a top-level `exit` ends the PROBE rather than the
# gate and simply fails to print the sentinel; a broken file fails to source and
# prints nothing; and `unset -f` inside the probe means a name that survives can
# only have come from the file. The sentinel must be printed AFTER the source
# returns, which is what makes "the source completed" observable at all.
# STDIN IS CLOSED FOR THE PROBE and the library's own stderr is KEPT.
# Round 2's review measured both: the probe inherited the gate's stdin, so a
# library containing `read` CONSUMED it and left the rest of the gate with
# nothing; and `2>/dev/null` discarded the library's own diagnosis, so a file
# that failed for a nameable reason reported only the generic cause-list below.
# A guard that makes the verdict loud and the cause silent is half a guard.
